## 🎯 Why This Helps

### Before:
```
❌ Can't see what's failing
❌ Can't debug from mobile
❌ Trial and error fixes
❌ Hours of frustration
```

### After:
```
✅ See exactly what fails
✅ Debug from mobile browser

## 🔍 What It Tests

The diagnostic tool checks **7 critical points**:

1. ✅ **Session** - Are you logged in?
2. ✅ **Database** - Is refresh_token saved?
3. ✅ **Scopes** - All permissions granted?
4. ✅ **Token** - Can we get access_token?
5. ✅ **Devices** - Any Spotify devices available?
6. ✅ **Playback** - Is something playing?
7. ✅ **Web SDK** - Is browser player loaded?

2. **Copy of the logs** from "Test API Calls" button
3. **Tell me** what you see (green checks vs red X's)

Example:
```
"I see:
- ✓ Session OK
- ❌ Database Account (says 'No refresh token found')

The Test API Calls logs say:
--- Step 1: Database Query ---
❌ No account found in database
