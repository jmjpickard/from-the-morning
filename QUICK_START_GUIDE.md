## Tips & Tricks

### Keep Tab Open
The browser tab must stay open for music to play. Minimize the window, but don't close the tab!

### Switch Seamlessly
You can switch from browser to phone mid-song:
1. Open device selection
2. Choose your phone
3. Playback transfers instantly

### Multiple Tabs
Opening multiple tabs will create multiple web player instances. They'll all appear in the device list!

### Battery Life (Mobile)
Playing music in the browser uses battery similar to the Spotify app. Consider:
- Lower screen brightness
- Close other tabs
- Use WiFi instead of cellular data

### Audio Quality
The web player automatically adjusts quality based on your network speed:
- Good connection = High quality
- Slower connection = Lower quality (but smooth playback)
